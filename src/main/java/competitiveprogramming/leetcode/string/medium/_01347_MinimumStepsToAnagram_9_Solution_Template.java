     * #################### INTUITION ####################
     * # Intuition
     * The two strings s and t have the same length.
     * 
     * We need to find the minimum characters that need to be replaced in t to make it an anagram of s
     * or (any one, not both)
     * We need to find the minimum characters that need to be replaced in s to make it an anagram of t
     * 
     * We do not need to touch the instances of a character that are present in both strings.
     * 
     * For example, if the two strings are s = ba and t = aa,
     * we do not need to change one of the 'a' characters in both two strings.
     * s = ba --> aa, // 1 char change, or 
     * t = aa --> ba // 1 char change, 
     * (Not 1+1 = 2 char change for both s and t)
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The minimum characters that need to be replaced in t to make it an anagram of s:
     * t --> s
